export const ABOUT_ME_TEXT: string = `
I am a software engineer working in research related to Human-Centered AI (HCAI).

I have experience working in collaborative environments with both technical and non-technical individuals, and I can communicate effectively in Spanish (native) and English (intermediate level). I approach my work with responsibility, commitment, and enthusiasm, always prioritizing teamwork and fostering a positive work environment to achieve our goals.

The research I participate in explores the interaction between humans and AI agents, covering topics such as collaborative AI, mutual theory of mind, and group ideation with AI tools.

Additionally, I am passionate about continuous learning and exploring new technologies and programming languages to apply my knowledge in solving new challenges in software development and human-centered AI research.
