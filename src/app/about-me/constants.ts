export const ABOUT_ME_TEXT: string = `
I'm a software engineer with over 2 years of experience.

I have a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, relational databases, and agile
methodologies, thanks to my university education. I have experience collaborating with both
technical and non-technical individuals, and I can communicate effectively in both Spanish (my native
language) and English (intermediate level). I approach my work with responsibility, commitment, enthusiasm,
and a focus on teamwork, always striving to promote the well-being of the team and achieve the desired
results. Additionally, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn new technologies and
programming languages, so that I can apply the knowledge I gain to tackle new challenges.
