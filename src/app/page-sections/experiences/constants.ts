        projectDescription: `
To understand the challenges of designing an agent that “fts in” to a group setting, we built an LLM-based conversational agent prototype called “Koala.” Koala is an AI-based group discussion participant, situated in Slack and implemented as a bot application. Given our desire to experiment with proactive ways of participating, we developed two confgurable variants of Koala (Figure 1): a reactive variant that only responds when directly addressed (by either “@Koala” or “Koala”), and a proactive variant that responds when it determines that it has something valuable to say. Koala can contribute to the conversation in the same manner as other human users, by sending textual messages as well as emoji-based reactions to existing messages.

  <figcaption class="project-description-image-caption">
    <strong>Figure 1: Koala as an AI participant in Slack.</strong> These screenshots (with human participant names redacted) show examples of Koala participating in a Slack channel. (A) The reactive variant of Koala replies to a user's question addressed to “Koala” (A.1) or to “@Koala” (A.2). (B) The proactive variant of Koala generates a proactive reply (B.1) to the conversation and a reactive reply (B.2) in response to a direct request.”
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In developing the proactive variant of Koala, we knew that writing imperative decision logic to determine what constitutes a valuable contribution would prove impossible; therefore, we relied on
the underlying LLM to not only produce conversational responses in response to users' messages, but also to score those responses for the extent to which they made a valuable contribution to the
conversation. We outline this process in Figure 2; at a high level, Koala is instructed to not reply to messages where it is clearly not the intended recipient, and to reply to messages when it estimates that the response it generated makes a valuable contribution to the conversation. We note that our proactive variant of Koala represents a limited form of proactivity as it’s process is triggered by the receipt of a message from a human user; a truly proactive variant of Koala would also be able to send messages to the group even when the human participants remain silent.

During Koala's development, we noticed that the underlying LLM was unreliable in identifying the intended target for a chat utterance. Thus, we incorporated additional, external control logic to force Koala to reply if it's name was detected in a user's message, and suppress Koala from replying under other circumstances, such as when the names of one of the other participants were mentioned, regardless of how the LLM scored the value of the reply's content.

    <strong>Figure 2: Koala operational logic.</strong> When users post a message in a Slack (A), the post triggers an event that is handled by the Koala backend (B) where control logic determines whether Koala should either immediately pass on replying or hand of for further evaluation in the autonomy control logic (C) where the LLM (D) generates a response that is further evaluated for potential posting in the channel.”

        projectDescription: `
The Collaboration Canvas is a prototype tool for exploring ways for groups to interact with large language models (LLMs) in ideation tasks. Collaboration Canvas provides a shared, graphical canvas in which multiple parties - human and LLM - can share ideas in the form of virtual “sticky notes” that can be moved around the canvas. As we aimed not to replicate a commercial product, it possesses a minimally-useful set of functionality commonly found in shared canvas tools:

- Multiple users are able to join the shared canvas environment and interact with it in real time. A list of connected users shows who is currently in the environment.
- Users are able to add, select, and remove sticky notes.
- Users are able to change the size, color, and position of sticky notes.
- Users are able to zoom in and out within the canvas.

  <figcaption class="project-description-image-caption">
    <strong>Figure 1: Collaborative Canvas user interface.</strong> The shared canvas provides a space for multiple users to add, remove, and move around virtual sticky notes. <strong>(A)</strong> A sidebar provides users with the ability to add new sticky notes in various colors. <strong>(B)</strong> Sticky notes can be placed and moved around the canvas. <strong>(C)</strong> A separate panel can be revealed to show a private scratchpad for generating new sticky notes with an LLM off of the main canvas. <strong>(D)</strong> User profile images represent the users who are currently connected to the canvas.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In addition to providing core shared canvas functionality, Collaborative Canvas also offers several different ways to invoke a large language model to generate new content:

- New sticky notes can be generated and added to the main canvas from a textual prompt in a modal (Figure 2). These notes are visible to all users when they are generated.

<figure id="generative_ai_capabilities">
  <img class="project-description-image" src="assets/images/collaboration_canvas/In_Canvas_Tools.png" alt="Generative AI capabilities within the shared canvas"/>
  <figcaption class="project-description-image-caption">
    <strong>Figure 2: Generative AI capabilities within the shared canvas.</strong> Users can generate sticky notes directly in the shared canvas view. <strong>(A)</strong> By right-clicking on the canvas and choosing “Generate” from the contextual menu, a user can access a dialog for generating sticky notes. The dialog allows the user to specify their prompt and request that a specific number of sticky notes are generated. <strong>(B)</strong> After clicking the “Generate Notes” button, new sticky notes are created (with an interstitial animation to hide LLM inference latency) in the main canvas. <strong>(C)</strong> When selecting one or more sticky notes, a pop-up toolbar allows users to re-generate the selected sticky notes with a new prompt. In this way, users are able to make refinements to their own (or generated) sticky notes, such as “provide a condensed summary” or “come up with new ideas.”
  </figcaption>
</figure>

- New sticky notes can be generated within a private scratchpad (Figure 3A & Figure 3B). Users are then able to drag sticky notes from the scratchpad into the shared canvas space (Figure 3C).
- Users can progressively refine the content of generated sticky notes through follow-up requests. The sequence of requests are preserved so that notes can be regenerated in the context of previous requests (Figure 3D).

<figure id="personal_scratchpad">
  <img class="project-description-image" src="assets/images/collaboration_canvas/Personal_Scratchpad.png" alt="Personal scratchpad"/>
  <figcaption class="project-description-image-caption">
    <strong>Figure 3: Personal scratchpad.</strong> As an alternative to generating public sticky notes on the shared canvas, we also developed a personal scratchpad for generating sticky notes, enabling users to review their content before sharing them with the group. <strong>(A)</strong> The scratchpad provides a separate space to prompt the LLM and generate new sticky notes. <strong>(B)</strong> The current state of the scratchpad is preserved between subsequent prompts, so a user can request that the sticky notes that were previously generated “say that with less text.” <strong>(C)</strong> Users can choose which sticky notes in their scratchpad they would like to share with the group by dragging them from the scratchpad to the main canvas. <strong>(D)</strong> Users can view their progressive prompts and regenerated responses in a chat-like sequential view that can be clicked to navigate back to older versions of generated note sets.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In addition to these core features, the Collaboration Canvas also includes proactive capabilities designed to assist users in ideation:

- Medium-level proactivity: In this version of the tool, the LLM automatically suggests sticky notes based on the user's input. Once the user finishes typing their idea on a sticky note, the LLM will generate suggested notes related to the user's idea (Figure 4).

<figure id="medium_level_proactivity">
  <img class="project-description-image" src="assets/images/collaboration_canvas/Medium_Level_Proactivity.png" alt="Medium-level Proactivity"/>
  <figcaption class="project-description-image-caption">
    <strong>Figure 4: Medium-level Proactivity</strong> The user will see a "Launch AI" icon replace the loading icon <strong>(A)</strong> once the suggestions are ready. When the user clicks on this icon, the suggestions in the form of sticky notes will appear in a dark box, visible only to the user who wrote the original sticky note <strong>(B)</strong>. If the user finds a suggestion useful, they can simply drag it onto the main board.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

- Full proactivity: In this mode, the LLM acts as a virtual brainstorming partner, creating sticky notes autonomously. It remains context-aware, meaning it knows the content of the other sticky notes and generates new ideas without overlapping existing ones. The notes will be placed in empty spaces near other related ideas (Figure 5).

  <figcaption class="project-description-image-caption">
    <strong>Figure 5: Full Proactivity</strong>  This mode includes additional controls, such as:
   - A toggle switch to activate or deactivate LLM-generated note creation <strong>(A)</strong>.
   - A slider to control the frequency of AI-generated notes, with options ranging from every 30 seconds to every 3 minutes <strong>(B)</strong>.
   - A slider to set the number of sticky notes generated each time, from 1 to 10 notes per cycle <strong>(C)</strong>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

We implemented the Collaborativon Canvas using the Svelte framework for the front-end UI and Python with FastAPI for the back end. The back end was responsible for communicating with an internal version of the IBM watsonx.ai platform where the LLM was hosted. While this platform provides API access to a number of state-of-the-art LLMs, we chose the Llama 2 model for our prototyping and experiments. We developed a prompt for this model to set the context for users' actions, including generating sticky notes and progressively refining generated responses. This prompt also instructed the model to format its responses in a way that was easy to parse into separable chucks by the front end. In Figure 6, it is illustrated the flow that occurs from the moment a user requests the LLM to generate a group of sticky notes until they are generated.

  <img class="project-description-image" src="assets/images/collaboration_canvas/Canvas_Sticky_Notes_Generation_Flow.png" alt="Sticky Notes Generation Flow"/>
  <figcaption class="project-description-image-caption">
    <strong>Figure 6: Sticky Notes Generation Flow.</strong> The diagram shows the activity flow for generating sticky notes. First, the user enters a query in their personal scratchpad. Next, the front-end UX calls an API endpoint in the back end, which looks up the user's canvas session information from the database. Then, if the user is making a refinement to existing sticky notes, the system retrieves the request/response history for those sticky notes. Next, the system loads the prompt template and fills it in with the user's query and any retrieved refinement history. Finally, the system calls the LLM (via API) with the prompt to obtain a response, parses that response into a set of individual sticky notes, and adds them to the scratchpad UI.
